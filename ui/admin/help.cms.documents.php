	<h1>Documents</h1>

	<p>
		The <strong>File Manager</strong> is similar to your usual Windows or Mac documents explorer.
		Due to HTML5's advanced features, you're able to even <strong>drag-and-drop</strong> files from your computer to the Documents area
		and they will be promptly uploaded in the current folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your current folder is mentioned on the top-left side of the File Manager, next to the Home button which resets the working folder to the top-most root
		folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		The usual features of a File Manager are available: create/rename/delete folders, upload/rename/delete files. You may also choose to view the list of
		files in a thumbnail or list view.
